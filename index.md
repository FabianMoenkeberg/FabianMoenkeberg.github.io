Hi, I just finished my PhD in mathematics at EPFL Lausanne. Currently, I am looking for a new challenge for future. My main areas of expertise includes
* Hyperbolic conservation laws
* Radial basis functions
* Scientific programming

I am interested in the application of mathematical and computational methods to challenging problems from physics and engineering.
