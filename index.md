Hi, I just finished my PhD in mathematics at EPFL Lausanne. I am happy to join Ziemer Ophthalmic Systems AG in February 2021 as software engineer for numerical methods. My main areas of expertise include
* Hyperbolic conservation laws
* Radial basis functions
* Scientific programming

I am interested in the application of mathematical and computational methods to challenging problems from physics and engineering.
